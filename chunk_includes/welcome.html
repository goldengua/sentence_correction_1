    <p>Welcome!</p>

    <p>We are annotating human speech data, and we need your help to find out typos or speech errors in the transcription.</p>

    <p>In each trial, you will see some context, followed by a key sentence marked in <b>BOLD</b>.</p>

    <p>There might be an error in some key sentences.</p>

    <p>If you believe there is an error in the transcription, then you may correct it by replacing the erroneous word with a more appropriate choice.</p>

    <p>Please do not add or delete any word, just swap the erroneous word with an appropriate replament.</p>

    <p>If the sentence looks good, or you are unsure what is the intended meaning, leave it unchanged.</p>

    <p>Most punctuation marks have been removed from the items that you will encounter (except periods and apostrophes).</p> 
    
    <p>Please do not add any new punctuation to, or change any capitalization in the target sentence, unless it is part of the word-level correction (e.g.when correcting I to you). </p>

    <p>Indicate your confidence level with the slider below.</p>
