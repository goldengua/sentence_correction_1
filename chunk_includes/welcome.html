    <p>We are annotating human speech data, and we need your help to find out typos or speech errors in the transcription.</p>

    <p>In each trial, you will see some context, followed by a key sentence marked in <b>BOLD</b>.</p>

    <p>In some key sentences, at most ONE word might be an error.</p>

    <p>Guess what is INTENDED by the speaker, and correct the errorneous word accordingly.</p>

    <p>Make MINIMAL edits to the incorrect word in key sentence to make it right.</p>

    <p>If the sentence looks good, or you are unsure what is the intended meaning, leave it unchanged.</p>
