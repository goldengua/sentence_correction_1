    <p>Welcome!</p>

    <p>We are annotating human speech data, and we need your help to find out typos or speech errors in the transcription.</p>

    <p>In each trial, you will see some context, followed by a key sentence marked in <b>BOLD</b>.</p>

    <p>In some key sentences, there is exactly ONE erroneous word.</p>

    <p>Guess what is INTENDED by the speaker, and substitute the erroneous word with the intended word you've guessed.</p>
    
    <p>Make sure your correction involves MINIMAL edits.</p>

    <p>Please do not add or delete any word. Only replace the erroneous word with a single word.</p>

    <p>If the sentence looks good, or you are unsure what is the intended meaning, leave it unchanged.</p>

    <p>Most punctuation marks have been removed from the items that you will encounter (except periods and apostrophes).</p> 
    
    <p>Please do not add any new punctuation to, or change any capitalization in the target sentence, unless it is part of the word-level correction (e.g.when correcting I to you). </p>

    <p>Indicate your confidence level with the slider below.</p>
